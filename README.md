What we designed is a news app, and its audience is concentrated in the age range of 20 to 50 years old. We designed this news app to solve the problem that people can view news anytime, anywhere.

Compared with other news apps, it can better exclude some unconfirmed news. In addition, it also collects the interests of some users and pushes some interesting news content to them. And most importantly, this news app is completely free.
